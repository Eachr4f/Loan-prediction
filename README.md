# Loan-prediction
Description</br>
This project involves an analysis of loan data using a Jupyter notebook. The goal is to explore, clean, and visualize the data to better understand the factors influencing loan approval or rejection. The notebook uses popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn to perform these tasks.</br>
